### 📚 What I Learned

This project gave me a solid refresher on building clean, accessible UI components and handling responsive design. Here are a few things I’m proud of:

```css

button{
    width: 90%;
    padding: 12px;
    border: none;
    background-color: var(--Grey700);
    color: var(--White);
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: 8px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
    font-family: "Inter";
}

```

## 🚀 Continued Development

I want to continue sharpening my skills in:

- Creating fully accessible components   
- Perfecting responsive UI design
